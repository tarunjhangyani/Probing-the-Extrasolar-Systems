# Probing-the-Extrasolar-Systems
Exoplanetary data is gathered for this project through authorised NASA sources, and using Python as the primary programming language, the data is examined to determine whether there are any similarities between our solar system and other star systems. On the basis of parameters like eccentricity distribution and mass distribution, the similarities are judged and compared.
In addition, a distribution that attempts to investigate the distribution of Earth-like planets from the database has also been shown.
